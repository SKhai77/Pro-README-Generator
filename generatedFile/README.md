## Description
The project aims to create a command-line application using the Inquirer package (version 8.2.4) to dynamically generate a professional README.md file based on user input. This allows developers to effortlessly create README files, freeing up more time for actual project work. The application was developed with JavaScript/Node.js and utilizes Inquirer as an npm package.
